# Installation instructions

In the Jira Administration section select the 'Add-ons' tab and then go to the 'Manage add-ons' sub section.

From here click the link for 'Upload add-on' then click 'Choose File' and select the JAR file that is in the target folder. The file should be named something similar to 'testPlugin-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar', where the x's will denote the version number.

Afterwards click 'Upload' and the plugin will be installed.
